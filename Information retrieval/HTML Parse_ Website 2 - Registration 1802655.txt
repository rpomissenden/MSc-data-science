Health-related content is particularly challenging, due to the very specialized domain language, implicit differences in language characteristics depending on the content type (patient-generated content like discussion forum, blogs and other Internet sources, healthcare documentation and clinical records, professional or scientific publications, clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials documentation, etc.). Moreover, it is also critical to provide search solutions for non-English content as well as cross-language or multilingual IR solutions. This workshop will be a forum where the community can present and discuss current and future directions for the area based on the experience and results obtained in the BioASQ task. Moreover, the workshop proposal, in addition to the  MESINESP  ( ) session, will include an  Open Session  covering IR technologies for heterogeneous health-related content open to multiple languages with a particular interest in the exploitation of structured controlled vocabularies and entity linking. Among the proposed topics for this open session are:  multilingual and non-English health-related IR, concept indexing and text categorization strategies; generation of evaluation resources for biomedical document IR strategies; scalability, robustness and reproducibility of health and biomedical IR and text mining resources; use of specialized machine translation and advanced deep learning approaches for improving health related search results; medical Question Answering search tools; retrieval of multilingual health related web-content; and other related topics. Submission Details for Open Session All submissions must be written in English following Springer LNCS author guidelines and submitted as PDF files to EasyChair. At least one author per paper needs to register and attend the workshop to present the work.  Full papers:  maximum 6 pages including references Short papers:  maximum 3 pages including references  Abstracts:  maximum 1 page including references Springer LNCS:  EasyChair:      All accepted papers and abstracts will be published in an issue of CEUR-WS ( ).  Journal Special Issue The planned workshop functions as a venue for the different types of contributors, mainly task providers and solution providers, to meet together and exchange their experiences. We expect that investigation on the topics of the task will continue after the workshop, based on new insights obtained through discussions during the workshop. As a venue to compile the results of the follow-up investigation, a journal special issue will be organized to be published a few months after the workshop. The specific journal will be announced after negotiation with publishers Organizers Martin Krallinger (Text Mining unit at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)) Francisco M.
