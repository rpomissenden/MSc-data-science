Among the propose topic for this open session be : multilingual and non-English health-related IR , concept indexing and text categorization strategy ; generation of evaluation resource for biomedical document IR strategy ; scalability , robustness and reproducibility of health and biomedical IR and text mining resource ; use of specialized machine translation and advanced deep learning approach for improve health relate search result ; medical Question Answering search tool ; retrieval of multilingual health relate web-content ; and other related topic .
