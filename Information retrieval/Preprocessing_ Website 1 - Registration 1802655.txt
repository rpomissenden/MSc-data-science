it require participant to automatically predict memorability score for video that reflect the probability a video will be remember
task participant be provide with an extensive dataset of video that be accompany by memorability annotation as well as preextracted stateoftheart visual feature
the ground truth have be collect through recognition test and thus result from objective measurement of memory performance
participants will be require to train computational model capable of infer video memorability from visual content
optionally descriptive title attach to the video may be use
models will be evaluate through standard evaluation metric use in rank task spearman s rank correlation
the data set use in be the same as in s testset ground truth data have not be release
this year the task focus on understand the pattern in the data and improve the ability of algorithm to capture those pattern
task motivation and background the motivation for the task be the growth over recent year in the amount of multimedia content share and consume via online platform
enhancing the usefulness of multimedia require new way to organizein particular to recommend and retrievedigital content
like other aspect relate to video relevance such as aesthetic or interestingness memorability can be regard as useful to help make a choice between compete video
effective memorability prediction model will also push forward the semantic understanding of multimedia content by put human cognition and perception at the center of the multimedia analysis
a number of different application area benefit from deep understanding of what make some video memorable and others less so
these area include recommendation and retrieval in online platform already mention but also advertising filmmaking and education
it be increasingly important to understand what make video memorable in order to keep the use of automatic processing technique evenhanded
applications can make use of information about predict memorability but it be important to understand memorability well enough to be able to avoid system that be hyperoptimized to viewer response
target group researchers will find this task interest if they work in the area of human perception and the impact of multimedia on perception such as image and video interestingness memorability attractiveness aesthetic prediction event detection multimedia affect and perceptual analysis multimedia content analysis machine learning though not limit to
data the dataset be compose of soundless short video extract from raw footage use by professional when create content and in particular commercial
each video consist of a coherent unit in term of meaning and be associate with two score of memorability that refer to it probability to be remember after two different duration of memory retention
the video be share under creative commons license that allow their redistribution
they come with a set of preextracted feature such as dense sift hog descriptor lbp gist color histogram mfcc fc layer from alexnet cd feature etc
ground truth and evaluation each video consist of a coherent unit in term of meaning and be associate with two score of memorability that refer to it probability to be remember after two different duration of memory retention
memorability have be measure use recognition test ie
through an objective measure a few minute after the memorization of the video and then to hour later
the output of the prediction model ie
the predicted memorability score for the video will be compare with ground truth memorability score use classic evaluation metric eg
spearman s rank correlation
